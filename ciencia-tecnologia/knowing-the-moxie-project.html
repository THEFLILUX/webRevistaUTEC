                        On March 14, we interviewed Maya Nasr, an aerospace engineering PhD. student at MIT and a member of the MOXIE project that’s part of the seven instruments of NASA’s Perseverance rover. Maya already knows about our university community because she was part of the coaches team of the MIT Global Startup Labs program in Peru during the summer of 2018, which took place at UTEC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interview addresses Maya's experience in the MOXIE project and the importance of her research, which has as its main objective to produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. From this interview, we invite you to read more details of the instruments used in the Perseverance rover and the article “Sobre la Terraformación y lo que significa” published by PISO11.

                <h5><strong>Interview:</strong></h5>
                <h6><strong>Alessandra : So, let’s start. Maya can you please introduce yourself?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">Yeah, absolutely. I’m currently a PhD student from Lebanon, doing aerospace engineering at MIT and I’ve previously done my bachelor’s and master’s in aerospace engineering there as well. So that’s a brief introduction, and I’m working on MOXIE for the Mars rover 2020.</p>
                <h6><strong>Alessandra : Yeah, so… this is a question that we always ask to people we interview (referring to Arturo and her). What’s your favourite ice cream?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">Uhmm, tough choice (everyone laughs). I’m going with chocolate. It's always a great idea.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Arturo: Can you talk to us a little bit about the project? When did it begin? How did it begin?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">It began originally by a NASA announcement, an opportunity regarding technology to be aboard the Mars 2020 rover. Multiple proposals from all over the world were submitted, and it was a really competitive submission of proposals. Our PI proposed the idea of MOXIE, which uses Solid Oxide Electrolysis to do this ISRU [In-Situ Resource Utilization] experiment. After a lot of reviews by NASA, it got accepted and got picked to be one of the seven instruments aboard the Mars 2020 rover. I, personally, joined the team in 2016.
                </p>

                <p>So the idea behind it is: if you want to send people to Mars, you are going to help them to breathe, so you need oxygen for that. But at the same time, you want to always consider a way to get them back to Earth. So, in order to do that, you need to have rockets or propellant. First of all, to take them up to the surface of Mars via a Mars Ascent Vehicle, that takes them to orbit, and you need the other spacecraft to take them from orbit back to Earth. So, in order to do that, you're gonna need oxygen as an oxidizer for the propellant for a rocket, and this is extremely heavy. If you want to carry it all the way with you from Earth to Mars, it’d cost billions and billions of dollars. If you want to send a crew to Mars and you need to get them off the surface back to Earth, one of the things that make more sense is to basically "live off the land" and use in-situ resources utilization, a.k.a. using resources on Mars in order to create these propellants rather than carrying them with you all the way from Earth.
                </p>
                    
                <p> The idea behind MOXIE is: <strong>you've got the atmosphere on Mars, that is more than 95% carbon dioxide, how about we try to use this CO2 to our sake in order to produce something you want?</strong> We're trying, by MOXIE, to use Solid Oxide Electrolysis to get the CO2 in the atmosphere and make oxygen out of it. Right now, it's a technology demonstration, so that all the oxygen is produced at a low level, and it's basically not stored anywhere. It goes back to the atmosphere. But before you send any technology for human support, you need to test it and demonstrate it works on Mars right now. This is what MOXIE is doing. And when you send humans to Mars, a scaled up version of MOXIE is going to be sent where it allows for the storage of the produced oxygen and such for use.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Alessandra : Oh! That's really cool.</strong></h6>
                <h6><strong>Arturo: Yeah, before this interview, I was reading a bit about MOXIE. I really think it’s an awesome idea to produce the oxygen they are going to breathe there, and also to use as a fuel.</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">Yeah, and, of course, there are other ISRU technologies. You can dig under the surface of Mars and take the ice and make water. And water could be useful for people to drink, but at the same time, you could make methane. Out of that, combine methane and oxygen, which creates propellant for rockets. There are multiple technologies, but they're a bit more complicated because you need to dig in or more things. While CO2 it is literally there, you're surrounded by it. You can just absorb it, take it in, and do the process. It's a lot easier.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Alessandra : How did you get involved in the project?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    I started working on it [MOXIE] in 2016, when I was in my undergraduate years at MIT. At MIT you have opportunities for undergraduates to do research and partly at that point I was doing my own research on MOXIE to scale it up for a Mars Sampleeturn Mission. In order to  get the samples that we gather from Mars and bring them to Earth, we need a Mars Ascent Vehicle to take the samples off the surface of Mars and then come to Earth, so we need propellant for it, and I was working on scaling up MOXIE for that. Then I started getting involved, after 2016 with the modeling of MOXIE. Modeling as we do, simulations of models for that. At the same time, doing a lot of the hardware testing for purposes of calibration, characterization of different parts and sensors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm leading the downlink part of Mars surface operations which means now that we're in Mars, we do what we call Mars surface operations. There are people who are responsible in each team to uplink things, send  commands to the Mars 2020 rover or their specific instruments to do certain things, and you've got people on the downlink side, which means we receive the data from Mars, and we basically analyze and report on it. I'm leading the downlink part of MOXIE, so it's really exciting to have the first hands on the first data that you got from Mars. It's definitely been one of the best parts of the research right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that's why my scheduling was not good [everyone laughs]. Most of the downlink parts we work on Mars time, which means we're quite nocturnal in these shifts. Basically, when we get data, most of the times we want to operate during the day on Mars, which ends up not always being the day on Earth. So we end up working a lot of times on night shifts, because you've got cameras and other things you need to be able to operate during the day and a lot of times when you're on Mars, rather than a day on Earth. It shifts a lot of schedules for a lot of the people involved in operations to have night shifts and such.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Alessandra : Oh, and how do you manage your sleep cycle? It must be hard.</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    It's very interesting. At the beginning we had this kind of schedule where you need to move your schedule 40 minutes per day to basically start waking up, say for example at like 2pm and go to bed later and then the next day you do the other way around, to kind of shift to coordinate a cycle. I was very ambitious to start doing that in the beginning but then I couldn't really. I ended up whenever I had a night shift, I just tried to survive it during the day. All the planning that I tried to do in the beginning, it didn't really work in that sense. But some people are having even longer shift, which for these people it's a bit more annoying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I still have meetings and classes during the day as a student, so I need to be awake during the day, and if you have a night shift, you also need to be working during the night, and that's the case for all the operations. I've been lucky because my work is mostly on the downlink shifts so whenever we get data, I’m staffed. It's a bit less than other people's schedules because I only have to be available when the data is coming. It's a bit better in that sense. But It's definitely harder to manage when it comes to classes and actual PhD research that we're doing.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Arturo: What is the inspiration behind the project?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    The idea behind MOXIE is to be prepared for future human exploration of Mars. You won't be able to send people to Mars if you don't have such technologies because –I give this example off normally– if you're going backpacking and if you have to carry everything with you before you leave, you are limited by how long you can stay, you are limited by how far you can go, while if you can go fishing on your way, hunting for yourself and getting things in your way, you can last for way longer and you can go for way further. And that's a similar concept of making these things on Mars. Because [if this were the case] everyone would just send things to Mars. We can't constantly be sending things from Earth. We need to have some sustained form of life over there. So we need these technologies for people to be able to start making things all in Mars from Mars resources, to be able to stay alive and to also be able to come back to Earth when they want to. It's one of the most important steps for future human exploration of Mars. Again, scale up that version of it, but send their technology. So the whole inspiration is to be able to gain more resources, to stay longer and to do more. Basically to make a support system because you need to be able to breathe to support yourself and you need to be able to do that without carrying things from Earth. Any future human exploration mission is going to need it. And the most important part is –well, the breathing is important for sure– but the propellant is one of the things that takes the most amount of mass at launch, and that is a huge [advantage] to be able to produce on Mars rather than carry it from Earth.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Arturo: I read that the head of the investigation said it was comparable to a tree.</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    You can think about it as a mechanical tree, our PI likes to always give this comparison, because it's a correct analogy. Saying “See what you are producing, oxygen” and there's a tree. Right now, the amount of oxygen it produces it's literally like a tree, because it's not scaled up to that amount [to sustain humans]. Right now, it can keep a small dog alive, but the scaled up version of it will actually keep a true astronaut on Mars supplies. So you can think about it as a mechanical tree for sure and the way it produces oxygen, and, you know, the process we use is a process that it's common in terms of plants and stuff like taking CO2 and producing oxygen out of that. The use of CO2 to produce oxygen is a common thing in nature in general. It's just in the mechanical way of using it on Mars, with a different, and a bit harder technology of Solid Oxidation Electrolysis.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Alessandra : Where are you aiming with this project? The whole objective of doing this.</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    My personal aim is taking this data that we get after  landing, and analyse it; that's one of the main focuses of my PhD. But I'm also interested in space law and policy, researching this based on policy aspects of martian human exploration, the use of resources on Mars and how we make sure, in terms of ownerships of resources in terms of multinational approaches for motion missions and planetary protection. So my PhD is focused on both.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Alessandra : What were the challenges you had doing the project and during your career?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    I mean definitely this year has been a big challenge for everyone around the world but specifically in our project, because it involves a lot of hardware testing, the use of laboratories and running experiments. It's definitely a bit more challenging when everything's locked down. That has pushed our timeline and a lot of things up quite a bit, but NASA had the Mars 2020 mission as a top priority so thankfully we didn't get delayed. The idea is if you delay the launch from this year, you cannot launch until two years from now, which is in 2022, because of the way orbits work. That would cost a lot of money, so NASA keeps the Martian expanding mission launch as one of its top priorities to help during the spread of pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thankfully everything went smoothly. The pandemic pushed us to our limits, it was challenging in terms of work. But personally,  in general, one of the main challenges as foreign nationals in the US, is the access to the space industry due to a lot of restrictions or regulations in terms of expert control and such. When it comes to the martian flight project, the law definitely applies. The access you have for certain things is very limited in some ways or restricted to a certain extent. That’s been a constant challenge in the space industry but I’m grateful I’ve been able to participate and contribute in a lot of parts of it, which are still very interesting and crucial.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Arturo: Do you think any kind of version of the project could be used in favor of terraformation?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    As I mentioned before, that is when you actually want to make Mars a more habitable place, you want to be able to use other technologies, and I think if you're talking about actual terraforming of Mars at a bigger level, you're going to need different types of devices. You're going to need to make water based on digging in ice and getting a little water and methane,  which could be used as a propellant, but also could be used for planting because a lot of people are going to be planting in order to sustain themselves and be able to eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's going to be a combination of different technologies. MOXIE is going to definitely give you one of these technologies, and different versions and different choices and combinations with different things, but it's going to definitely be crucial for that. [Terraformation will require a combination of different technologies such as MOXIE. We are sure the use of MOXIE is crucial for this project. However, we are certain that there are different technologies we must combine it with to achieve our goals].
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Arturo: Because one of the most difficult points about terraforming Mars is the atmosphere and the relation between oxygen and nitrogen and the other gases because it's mostly everything just CO2.</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    Exactly, and you need to produce other gases out of it for various reasons. Again, for breathing, but also for planting, for eating, for sustaining effort balance and for everyday living. You're going to need a lot of chemical experiments in order to learn which technologies you will be able to use for the atmosphere, and also for underground use and dig to extract the ice and other resources under the surface of Mars. You're going to need a combination of both technologies before terraforming Mars, and that's way far in the future.
                </p>

                <h6><strong>Alessandra : Before you began this project, did you ever thought this kind of technology was possible?</strong></h6>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    To be completely honest, before I started working on this, I was generally more involved on projects that are satellite oriented, and projects that are planetary science oriented. I have worked before at Cassini on Saturn, it was more like the study of the surface of Saturn and Titan, and how we can predict the reasons for the formation of lakes on Titan and such.
                </p>

                    I wasn't involved in terms of Martian operations and technologies until I started this project, but the opportunities that you get out of them are incredible and we have been able at laboratories to prove that these technologies will work under Martian conditions. Hopefully, we're able to actually prove the results we want from the data we got on Mars. The idea is to prove its success under all conditions. basically during the day, night and all seasons. In addition, to dust storms and such, to prove its ability and efficiency to do what it's supposed to do in all these conditions.

                    So the next step, of course, is, as I mentioned, the scaled up version of this project. If we're going to use it for more sample return and if we're going for human missions, which is the point we care the most about. The most important part is to be able to scale up what we currently have to just support the amount of oxygen production needed and also to work on storage. So that's a big part of the scaling up. Now, and again, we are basically releasing this oxygen back to the atmosphere. The other step would be “Okay, now we're going to use this oxygen”, so we need to think about its storage and its liquefaction to put it into storable tanks in order to be used as propellants for rockets and for breathing. Start thinking of these steps: this is by far the most obvious next step for us. And maybe, in that sense, start to think of the different technologies that could collaborate with it, how can we collaborate with both technologies. But the most obvious next step for our project is a scaled up version. After we prove that we are able to operate successfully, which we hopefully are quite confident that we can.
